Title: taking screenshots
---

I've found the best way to handle screenshots is by using the Dropbox sync app to automatically add any images from your screenshots to a Dropbox folder. I got the autosync for Dropbox apk here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.apkpure.com/autosync-for-dropbox-dropsync/com.ttxapps.dropsync/amp

Once you've set that up and pointed it to your screenshots folder, just hold volume down + power button until the screenshot is taken. It will then be uploaded when the sync next runs.
