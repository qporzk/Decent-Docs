# Decent Docs

## NOTE

I'm trying out some doc hosting stuff on this repo for fun and to make it look a bit nicer. The Github Pages is here: https://qporzk.github.io/beautiful-test/

This repo is meant to be a knowledge base for beginners to the Decent espresso machine. It will begin based on Weis post here: https://3.basecamp.com/3671212/buckets/7351439/messages/2743471398
