[My Mods to DSx](<https://github.com/qporzk/Decent-Docs/blob/master/assets/skins/DSx Mods>)

- Add DSx_functions.tcl and DSx_skin.tcl to the DSx_Code_Files folder
-- Changes the tank level from milliliters to percent
-- Adds labels to the favorites cups that update when saving a new favorite 
- Add grind.dsx to the DSx_Plugins folder
-- Adds a plugin page for tracking various grinds settings. Intention is for each color to correspond to a coffee, then have 4 different grind settings for different profiles. Touch the text above a setting to edit it
