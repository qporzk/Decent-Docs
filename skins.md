[MimojaCafe](https://github.com/Mimoja/de1app_skin_MimojaCafe)

- A GHC-only cafe focused skin with themes, quick profile changes, and a super cool dev

[Damian's DSx](https://www.diy.brakel.com.au/dsx/)

- Highly configurable skin with large amount of value-add features

[My Mods to DSx](<https://github.com/qporzk/Decent-Docs/blob/master/assets/skins/DSx Mods>)

- Add DSx_functions.tcl and DSx_skin.tcl to the DSx_Code_Files folder
	- Changes the tank level from milliliters to percent
	- Adds labels to the favorites cups that update when saving a new favorite 
- Add grind.dsx to the DSx_Plugins folder
	- Adds a plugin page for tracking various grinds settings. Intention is for each color to correspond to a coffee, then have 4 different grind settings for different profiles
	- Touch the text above a setting to edit it

[My minimalist dark skin](https://github.com/qporzk/Decent-Docs/blob/master/assets/skins/SimpleBlack.zip)

- This is SUPER minimal, and basically useless if you have a GHC. Was mostly practice for getting to know tcl
