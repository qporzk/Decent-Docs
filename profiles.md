[Default Decent Profiles](http://bit.ly/decent-profiles)

This is a folder conatining all of the profiles that come on the Decent by default. These are useful for resetting the profile back to stock if you accidentally change something and want to get back to a default state.

[Decent Profile Collection](https://3.basecamp.com/3671212/buckets/7351439/documents/3422173525)

This is a collection created by a decent user that compiles most of the most popular community profiles. Thanks TMC!

[Damian's LR, LM Leva, and Slayer](https://www.diy.brakel.com.au/decent-profiles/)

These are Damian's profiles, widely used to reproduce the thicker shots from popular lever machines.

A new class of profiles, meant to automatically pick a flowrate to make the most of the grind size you have chosen. The standard shot should always be stopped at 30 seconds total time, regardless of ratio or grind.
